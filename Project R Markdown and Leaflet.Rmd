Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r library}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r leaflet, echo=FALSE}
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=-6.708506,lng=106.8235073, popup="My Home")
my_map
```
